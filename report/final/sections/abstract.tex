This paper seeks to provide an empirical basis to produce novel images from static human faces
using NeuroEvolution and Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) \cite{stanley2002evolving} and Compositional Pattern Producing
Networks (CPPNs) \cite{stanley2007compositional}. In this paper new insight gained regarding the problems of description
of a novelty operator \cite{lehman2010efficiently} and solution to the problem of user fatigue \cite{secretan2008picbreeder}.
Through the NEAT/CPPN process the algorithm has discovered increasingly perplexing and interesting results that may hint
at some deeper meaning and understanding of how image processing is done. This paper explores those interesting results
and presents interesting avenues for further research.
