This paper seeks to provide an emperical basis to produce novel images from static human faces
using NeuroEvolution and Augmenting Toplogies (NEAT) \cite{stanley2002evolving} and Compositional Pattern Producing Neural Networks (CPNN) \cite{stanley2007compositional}. 
In this paper new insight is produced into the problems of description of a novelty operator \cite{lehman2010efficiently} and solution to
the problem of user fatigue \cite{secretan2008picbreeder}. Through the NEAT/CPNN process the algorithm has discovered increasingly
preplexing and interesting results that may hint at some deeper meaning and understanding of how image processing is done. This paper
explores those interesting results and presents interesting avenues for further research.
