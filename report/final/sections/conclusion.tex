The goal of the research conducted and presented in this report was to explore the realm of possibilities around interactive evolution of CPPN neural networks as applied to the domain of warping bitmap images of human faces and, to some extent, anthropomorphic variations. The research was able to demonstrate a useful application allowing a user to interactively evolve the distortion on an image input to the system. The research conducted was also able to unveil some useful approaches toward boosting the effectiveness of the interactive evolutionary process through the previously mentioned correlated and uncorrelated approaches while also discussing their respective advantages and disadvantages. Presented here are some of the results obtained and some analysis of them and their origination. This research has also helped to identify some new avenues for research as well as illuminate some possible applications of the technology.
